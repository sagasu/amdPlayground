playing with JavaScript asynchronous module definition

There are 2 html files.
index.html, can be run w/o using a server - it works by using file protocol. For everything here, node or any module is not needed.
modulesClassesFun.html requires a server to run. Use http-server or a run command below to check it out.

```
npm run start  
```
